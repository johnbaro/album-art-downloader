    Known issues:
    The preview popups can display incorrectly (large black areas) when the size of the
    art changes while it is being shown. This will occur, for example, if the size of the
    art is unknown, as once a popup is shown the full size art will be downloaded, and
    the size determined from that.

    workaround is to re-open the preview popup by releasing and re-clicking on the
    thumbnail.

     search windows from the file browser.

    Improved detection of changed scripts for recreating the script cache
    
0.4 Local Files Source now has the ability to specify the path to search for images in
     separately to the path to save images in. Set this either in the Local Files Source
     settings, or using the /localImagesPath command line parameter.

0.3 Stability improvements:
      Stop All should not cause the app to become unresponsive
      Fixed bug where app could hang while previewing during a search
