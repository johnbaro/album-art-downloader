0.3 Stability improvements:
      Stop All should not cause the app to become unresponsive
      Fixed bug where app could hang while previewing during a search
    If a search is performed for the same album and artist, but with different sources,
     a minimal search is now performed where only the newly selected sources are queried,
     and the existing results are kept in the same window.
    Added better error reporting. If a crash occurs, an errorlog.txt file will be produced.

    Added ability to toggle display of thumbnail information to go below the thumbnail
    Enhanced auto download of full size images to give the options: Always, Never, and Only For Unknown Size
    Added an optional Maximum Image size restriction
    Fixed bug where Local Files source would lock the files it found, preventing them from being replaced
    Added checkbox for setting AutoClose behaviour in the UI.
    Added option to disable AutoClose behaviour from the command line: "/autoclose off"
    Added option to restrict the maximum number of results to return per source
