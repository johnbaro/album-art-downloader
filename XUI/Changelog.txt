0.9 Added Foobar2000 library browser
    Improved performance of search results thumbnails list
    Improved handling of larger-than-screen preview popups
    Fixed Coveralia and Yes24 scripts which had become out of date
    Updated to version 0.7.5.2 of the MediaInfo tag reading library
    Persistent Preview window (right click on a result and choose "Preview...")
    Added command line parameter for setting the sorting to use for results
    All sources now limit the results returned to the first 10 by default.
    Fixed bug where all windows would share a single remembered size, so
     windows of different types now remember their size independently.
    Added re-use of existing search window from the command line, if "Open
     Results in New Window" option is turned off, and there is only one search
     window currently open, and search terms are passed on the command line.
    
    Known issues:
    The preview popups can display incorrectly (large black areas) when the size of the
    art changes while it is being shown. This will occur, for example, if the size of the
    art is unknown, as once a popup is shown the full size art will be downloaded, and
    the size determined from that.
    
    This is a known Microsoft bug with WPF Popups, due to be fixed by them soon. The only 
    workaround is to re-open the preview popup by releasing and re-clicking on the
    thumbnail.

0.8 Added Drag and Drop support to drop files and folders on to the File Browser window
    Cancel All button in Queue Manager window
    Warning added, if queueing large number of searches from the File Browser

    Script Cache DLL creation made compatible with running without admin privileges on Vista
     Note: If you are upgrading from a previous version, the "boo script cache.dll" file in
           your scripts folder should be deleted.
    Fixed bug where the same path would be used for all search windows when opening multiple
     search windows from the file browser.
     
0.5 Added File Browser
    Added Single-Instance behaviour. Only one instance of the application will now be
     allowed to run (others will have their command line parameters passed on to the first
     for execution).
    Added Window list menu.
    Added FreeCovers script, and updated Google script
    Improved detection of changed scripts for recreating the script cache
    
0.4 Local Files Source now has the ability to specify the path to search for images in
     separately to the path to save images in. Set this either in the Local Files Source
     settings, or using the /localImagesPath command line parameter.
    Experimental authenticating proxy support (undocumented feature)
    
0.3 Stability improvements:
      Stop All should not cause the app to become unresponsive
      Fixed bug where app could hang while previewing during a search
    If a search is performed for the same album and artist, but with different sources,
     a minimal search is now performed where only the newly selected sources are queried,
     and the existing results are kept in the same window.
    Added better error reporting. If a crash occurs, an errorlog.txt file will be produced.
